    <p class="p1">In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, 
        supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition of a tree
         may be narrower, including only wood plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable 
         as lumber or plants above a specified height. In wider definitions, the taller palms,
          tree ferns, bananas, and bamboos are also trees. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include
           a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a trunk and branches as a way to
            tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching
             several thousand years old. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is 
             estimated that there are some three trillion mature trees in the world.<br><br>

        A tree typically has many secondary branches supported clear of the ground by the trunk. 
        This trunk typically contains woody tissue for strength, and vascular tissue to carry materials
         from one part of the tree to another. For most trees it is surrounded by a layer of bark which 
         serves as a protective barrier. Below the ground, the roots branch and spread out widely; they 
         serve to anchor the tree and extract moisture and nutrients from the soil. Above ground, the
          branches divide into smaller branches and shoots. The shoots typically bear leaves, which 
          capture light energy and convert it into sugars by photosynthesis, providing the food for 
          the tree's growth and development.<br><br>
        
        Trees usually reproduce using seeds. Flowers and fruit may be present, but some trees, 
        such as conifers, instead have pollen cones and seed cones. Palms, bananas, and bamboos
         also produce seeds, but tree ferns produce spores instead.<br><br>
        
        Trees play a significant role in reducing erosion and moderating the climate. 
        They remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store large quantities of
         carbon in their tissues. Trees and forests provide a habitat for many species of 
         animals and plants. Tropical rainforests are among the most biodiverse habitats in
          the world. Trees provide shade and shelter, timber for construction, fuel for cooking 
          and heating, and fruit for food as well as having many other uses. In parts of the world,
           forests are shrinking as trees are cleared to increase the amount of land available for
            agriculture. Because of their longevity and usefulness, trees have always been revered,
             with sacred groves in various cultures, and they play a role in many of the world's 
             mythologies.<br><br>
             The tree growth habit is an evolutionary adaptation found in different groups of plants:
              by growing taller, trees are able to compete better for sunlight.[15] Trees tend to be
               tall and long-lived,[16] some reaching several thousand years old.[17] Several trees
                are among the oldest organisms now living.[18] Trees have modified structures such as
                 thicker stems composed of specialised cells that add structural strength and durability,
                  allowing them to grow taller than many other plants and to spread out their foliage. 
                  They differ from shrubs, which have a similar growth form, by usually growing larger
                   and having a single main stem;[6] but there is no consistent distinction between a 
                   tree and a shrub,[19] made more confusing by the fact that trees may be reduced in
                    size under harsher environmental conditions such as on mountains and subarctic areas.
                     The tree form has evolved separately in unrelated classes of plants in response to 
                     similar environmental challenges, making it a classic example of parallel evolution.
                      With an estimated 60,000-100,000 species, the number of trees worldwide might total
                       twenty-five per cent of all living plant species.[20][21] The greatest number of 
                       these grow in tropical regions and many of these areas have not yet been fully 
                       surveyed by botanists, making tree diversity and ranges poorly known.<br><br>
                       The majority of tree species are angiosperms. There are about 1000 species of gymnosperm 
                       trees,[23] including conifers, cycads, ginkgophytes and gnetales; they produce seeds which 
                       are not enclosed in fruits, but in open structures such as pine cones, and many have tough 
                       waxy leaves, such as pine needles.[24] Most angiosperm trees are eudicots, the "true
                        dicotyledons", so named because the seeds contain two cotyledons or seed leaves. 
                        There are also some trees among the old lineages of flowering plants called basal 
                        angiosperms or paleodicots; these include Amborella, Magnolia, nutmeg and avocado,
                        [25] while trees such as bamboo, palms and bananas are monocots.
